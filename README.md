# IOT balkony-watering-system

## Introduction
You would like to have a green oasis on your balkony but you are tired of carrying heavy watering cans every day? Than here's your solution - simply bring your flowers into the world of the internet of things! I built a watering system around a ESP32 microcontroller which is now watering our plants automatically. All you need is your smartphone for setting up the system and controlling it.

In the current status of the project the system can automatically water up to 4 strands independently. I created a web interface with which you can connect to the uC via wifi and adjust your system just right for your plants needs. 
Future features which are not yet realized include a soil moisture sensor which e.g. can detect if it was raining and the plants don't need to be watered.
